Polymorphism means many Forms.

A set of code behaves differently in different context then we call it Polymorphism.

Basically polymorphism is of two types:
    1. Compile Time polymorphism
    2. Run Time Polymorphism


1. Compile Time Polymorphism:
    It can be acheived by the 
        a). Function Overloading (or) Operator overloading 
        b). Fuction Overriding (or) Method Overriding
    

    Function Overloading means we can have different fuctions with same name but there is a structural difference 
    Example:
        #include<iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int test(int a, int b){

        }

        int test(int a){
            
        }

        int test(){

        }

        int main(){
            
        }

        Here test() is have multiple funtions with same name but there is some difference in it. 

NOTE:
   But we "cannot diffentiate" two funtions with "return type" as to show funtion overloading. It will give "error" 

   EXample: 
          int test (){                      |           void test(){
                                            |
            }                               |               }
           
           as we see, above both "cannot diffentiate" two funtions with "return type".
